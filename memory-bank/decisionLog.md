# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-08-14 14:29:32 - Initial decision log created for AI-SDLC framework

## Decision

**Memory Bank Architecture for AI-SDLC Framework Demo** - Implemented modular Memory Bank structure with separate files for different contexts (product, active, progress, decisions, patterns)

## Rationale

* **Context Preservation** - Enables AI assistants to maintain project context across sessions and mode switches
* **Modular Organization** - Separates different types of information for better maintainability and updates
* **Cross-Mode Compatibility** - Allows different AI modes to access and update relevant context information
* **Scalability** - Structure can grow with project complexity while maintaining organization

## Implementation Details

* **File Structure**: 5 core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md)
* **Update Strategy**: Timestamp-based append operations to preserve historical context
* **Access Pattern**: Sequential reading of all files during Memory Bank activation
* **Content Format**: Markdown with consistent formatting and timestamp requirements

## Decision

**Target Technology Stack for Demo** - Laravel (PHP) backend with React (JavaScript/TypeScript) frontend for AI-SDLC demonstration

## Rationale

* **Industry Relevance** - Laravel and React represent popular, modern web development technologies
* **AI Integration Potential** - Both frameworks offer extensive APIs and tooling for AI integration
* **Community Support** - Large developer communities with extensive documentation and examples
* **Scalability** - Both technologies support enterprise-scale applications

## Implementation Details

* **Backend**: Laravel framework with AI-enhanced APIs, middleware, and service patterns
* **Frontend**: React with AI-assisted component generation, testing, and optimization
* **Integration Points**: API communication, real-time features, and shared AI tooling
* **Demo Scope**: Complete working applications showcasing AI-SDLC at each development phase

## Decision

**GitHub Actions hashFiles Expression Syntax Fix** - Corrected three instances of improper hashFiles function usage in security.yml workflow by adding required ${{}} expression syntax

## Rationale

* **Syntax Compliance** - GitHub Actions requires all functions and expressions to be wrapped in ${{}} syntax when used in conditional statements
* **Workflow Functionality** - Without proper syntax, the container security scanning job would fail to evaluate conditions correctly
* **CI/CD Stability** - Ensures the security workflow runs properly when Docker files are present in the repository

## Implementation Details

* **Lines Fixed**: 168 (job-level condition), 181 (step-level condition), 189 (step-level condition)
* **Change Pattern**: `if: hashFiles('Dockerfile*') != ''` â†’ `if: ${{ hashFiles('Dockerfile*') != '' }}`
* **Impact**: Container security scanning now properly conditionally executes based on Dockerfile presence
* **Testing**: Workflow syntax validation will pass, conditional logic will function as intended
