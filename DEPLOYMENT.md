```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Verify Framework Status
```bash
# Run validation script
npm run validate

# Expected output:
# 🔍 Validating AI-SDLC Setup...
# ✅ ESLint available
# ✅ Prettier available
# ✅ Husky available
# 📊 Validation Results: 3/4 checks passed
```

### 2. Test Git Hooks
```bash
# Create a test change
echo "// Test comment" >> test-file.js

# Stage and attempt commit (should trigger pre-commit hook)
git add test-file.js
git commit -m "test: verify git hooks functionality"

# Clean up test file
rm test-file.js
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Integration
```bash
# Check repository status
gh repo view

# List recent commits
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/commits --jq '.[0].commit.message'

# Check repository topics/labels
gh repo edit --add-topic "ai-sdlc,framework,development-tools"
```

## 🚦 CI/CD Integration (Next Steps)

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-sdlc.yml
name: AI-SDLC Quality Gates

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        name: ESLint
        entry: npx eslint
        language: node
        files: \.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
      - id: prettier
        name: Prettier
